Let me show you how!\n","\n","### Step 1: Creating project\n","\n","Before you start, you need to create a Roboflow [account](https://app.roboflow.com/login). Once you do that, you can create a new project in the Roboflow [dashboard](https://app.roboflow.com/). Keep in mind to choose the right project type. In our case, Object Detection.\n","\n","<div align=\"center\">\n","  <img\n","    width=\"640\"\n","    src=\"https://media.roboflow.com/preparing-custom-dataset-example/creating-project.gif?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1672929799852\"\n","  >\n","</div>\n","\n","### Step 2: Uploading images\n","\n","Next, add the data to your newly created project.
